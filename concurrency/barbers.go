// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_barber_problem

// The Sleeping Barber dilemma, a classic computer science problem
// which illustrates the complexities that arise when there are multiple operating system processes. Here, we have
// a finite number of barbers, a finite number of seats in a waiting room, a fixed length of time the barbershop is
// open, and clients arriving at (roughly) regular intervals. When a barber has nothing to do, he or she checks the
// waiting room for new clients, and if one or more is there, a haircut takes place. Otherwise, the barber goes to
// sleep until a new client arrives. So the rules are as follows:
//
//		- if there are no customers, the barber falls asleep in the chair
//		- a customer must wake the barber if he is asleep a customer arrives while the barber is working, t
//		- the customer leaves if all chairs are occupied and
//		  sits in an empty chair if it's available
//		- when the barber finishes a haircut, he inspects the waiting room to see if there are any waiting customers
//		  and falls asleep if there are none
// 		- shop can stop accepting new clients at closing time, but the barbers cannot leave until the waiting room is
//	      empty
//		- after the shop is closed and there are no clients left in the waiting area, the barber
//		  goes home
// The Sleeping Barber was originally proposed in 1965 by computer science pioneer Edsger Dijkstra.
